# CryptoAssignment1
Assignment in a cryptography course, showcasing the use of simple encryption/decryption, crypto analysis
of an extended atbash cipher, the spartan scytale cipher and a polybius square cipher
as well as the use of a dictionary file, to detect a plaintext and accomplish the crypto analysis

Refer to A1_solution.py
has the code for the encryption/decrpytion and crpyto analysis

Refer to A1_test.py
to actually test A1_solution.py and see that the code runs properly

note the plaintexts and ciphertexts are used for the encryption and decrption and decrption tests

note utilities.py file holds helper functions to support the making of the A1_solution.py

engmix.txt is a the dictionary file
